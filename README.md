This project focuses on building a regression model to predict insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and other relevant features. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

**Technologies Used**
Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook
Machine Learning (Regression Models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

**Dataset Information**
Age – Age of the individual
Sex – Gender (Male/Female)
BMI – Body Mass Index
Children – Number of dependents
Smoker – Whether the person is a smoker (Yes/No)
Region – The region where the individual resides
Charges – The actual insurance cost (Target variable)

**Methodology**
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Handling missing values (if any)
Encoding categorical variables
Normalizing numerical features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understanding feature distributions
Correlation analysis between features
Identifying key factors that influence insurance charges
Feature Engineering:
Transforming and creating new relevant features
Handling outliers in BMI and age
Model Training & Evaluation:

**Implementing regression models:**
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
Comparing model performance using evaluation metrics like:
R² Score
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Key Findings**
Smokers tend to have significantly higher insurance costs compared to non-smokers.
BMI and age have a positive correlation with insurance charges, meaning that higher BMI and older age lead to increased costs.
The region of residence does not significantly affect insurance charges.
The Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models performed the best in terms of prediction accuracy.

**Problem Statement**
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the insurance charges for individuals using relevant features. This helps in:
Providing better insights into how different factors affect insurance costs.
Assisting insurance companies in setting fair premiums based on risk assessment.
Helping individuals understand which factors contribute to their premium costs.

**Future Improvements**
Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
Deploying the model as an API.
Exploring advanced ML models like XGBoost.
